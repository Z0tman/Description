Here is Zotman, I like programming languages such as C++, python or Javascript.

I do many mathematics and game development.

I subscribed here because I want to learn data programming by making my own open source project which would be to allow people to take their wound into pictures, that would be located into a world map which could be accompagned with a certified witness, giving a clue about orientation before and after the accident, which data could possibly save other people lives if well connected together when really needed.

It is just an idea, I don't really know how to make it happen, but that would allow us to acquire a more difficult information about the influence source which can make people change their behavior generally speaking.

I am not interesting in gore gash things, but only in small wounds which people can learn why bigs and smalls beings should be living peacefully together without waging war bewteen one another.

The data base learning would be based upon volonteers actions, which would solve miscellanous information data leaks from social websites.

I don't really know how it is going to happen, but if people read my description details, maybe that would save time for everybody, because time recovery is not a gain of time for anybody.
